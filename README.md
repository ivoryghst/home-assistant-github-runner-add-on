# GitHub Actions Runner Add-on for Home Assistant

[![GitHub Release][releases-shield]][releases]
![Project Stage][project-stage-shield]

A Home Assistant add-on that runs a self-hosted GitHub Actions runner in a Docker container.

## About

This add-on allows you to run a self-hosted GitHub Actions runner directly within your Home Assistant installation. This is useful when you want to run GitHub Actions workflows on your own infrastructure, with access to your local network and resources.

## Installation

1. Add this repository to your Home Assistant add-on store
2. Install the "GitHub Actions Runner" add-on
3. Configure the add-on with your repository URL and runner token
4. Start the add-on

## Configuration

The add-on requires the following configuration options:

### Option: `repo_url` (required)

The URL of the GitHub repository where you want to register the runner.

Example: `https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo`

For organization-level runners, use: `https://github.com/yourorganization`

### Option: `runner_token` (required)

The registration token for the GitHub Actions runner. You can generate this token from:

- **Repository runners**: Go to your repository → Settings → Actions → Runners → New self-hosted runner
- **Organization runners**: Go to your organization → Settings → Actions → Runners → New runner

**Important Notes**:
- The token is **valid for only 1 hour** after generation
- You must configure and start the add-on within that time frame
- If you see 404 errors during registration, the token has likely expired - generate a new one
- The token is a long string (typically 50+ characters) starting with letters and containing alphanumeric characters

### Option: `runner_name` (optional)

A custom name for the GitHub Actions runner. This allows you to identify your runner more easily, especially when managing multiple runners.

If not set, GitHub will automatically generate a runner name (typically based on the hostname).

Example: `my-home-assistant-runner`

Default: Empty (auto-generated by GitHub)

### Option: `runner_name` (optional)

A custom name for the GitHub Actions runner. This allows you to identify your runner more easily, especially when managing multiple runners.

If not set, GitHub will automatically generate a runner name (typically based on the hostname).

Example: `my-home-assistant-runner`

Default: Empty (auto-generated by GitHub)

### Option: `debug_logging` (optional)

Enable debug/verbose logging for troubleshooting. When enabled, the add-on will output additional information including:
- Operating system version
- Installed dependency packages
- Runner directory contents
- Runner version information
- Detailed command execution traces

Default: `false`

### Example Configuration

```yaml
repo_url: "https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo"
runner_token: "YOUR_RUNNER_TOKEN_HERE"
runner_name: "my-home-assistant-runner"
debug_logging: false
```

## How to Use

1. Navigate to your GitHub repository or organization settings
2. Go to Settings → Actions → Runners → New self-hosted runner
3. Copy the registration token provided
4. Configure this add-on with:
   - Your repository URL (e.g., `https://github.com/username/repo`)
   - The registration token you just copied
5. Start the add-on
6. The runner will appear as online in your GitHub repository/organization

## Features

- ✅ Self-hosted GitHub Actions runner
- ✅ Runs within Home Assistant as an add-on
- ✅ Supports multiple architectures (amd64, aarch64, armhf, armv7, i386)
- ✅ Automatic cleanup on shutdown
- ✅ Easy configuration through Home Assistant UI

## Troubleshooting

### 404 Error During Runner Registration

If you see an error like:
```
Http response code: NotFound from 'POST https://api.github.com/actions/runner-registration'
Response status code does not indicate success: 404 (Not Found).
```

This typically means:

1. **Token Expired** (Most Common): Registration tokens expire after 1 hour
   - Solution: Generate a new token from GitHub and update the add-on configuration
   
2. **Invalid Repository URL**: The URL format is incorrect
   - Correct format for repository: `https://github.com/owner/repo`
   - Correct format for organization: `https://github.com/organization`
   - Do NOT add trailing slashes or extra paths
   
3. **Insufficient Permissions**: You don't have admin rights to the repository/organization
   - Solution: Ensure you have admin access to create self-hosted runners

4. **Wrong Token Type**: Using a Personal Access Token (PAT) instead of a runner registration token
   - Solution: Use the registration token from the "New self-hosted runner" page, not a PAT

### Quick Fix Steps

1. Go to your GitHub repository or organization
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Actions** → **Runners**
3. Click **New self-hosted runner**
4. Copy the **registration token** from the configuration command shown
5. Update this add-on's configuration with the new token
6. Restart the add-on immediately (within 1 hour)
